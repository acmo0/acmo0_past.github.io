I am a Telecom SudParis student, passionate by **cyber security** (mainly cryptography and forensic), **computer science** and **maths**. I made various projects which can be found [on my github profile](https://github.com/acmo0). I also enjoy CTF ! Some of my write-up con be found on this blog. I joined recently [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org), at  team of students who do lots of CTF and also organize the [404CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr).
