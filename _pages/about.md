I am a Telecom SudParis student, passionate by **cyber security** (mainly cryptography and forensic), **computer science** and **maths**. I made various projects which can be found [on my github profile](https://github.com/acmo0). I also enjoy CTF plus I have a [root-me profile](https://root-me.org/acmo0) ! Some of my write-up can be found on this blog. I joined recently [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org), at  team of students who do lots of CTF and also organize the [404CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr). I also do some presentations on my campus about the RSA cryptosystem, symetric cryptosystems (especialy AES and block ciphers), differential cryptanalysis and Man in The Middle attacks using arp poisoning.
More recently, I became very involved in the management of the club's IT infrastructure.
